Now before going into this assignment, there are a few aspects which I need to understand a bit further before learning how to implement it into my assignment. Today, I'll have a look at **classes**.

After reading both the blog post by [Thomas Capagrepo](http://thomas.capogre.co/rmit/ccs/2022/09/06/classes.html) as well as watching the video tutorial by [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-HGdc8L-7w), I've gathered a bit more understanding of how they work. *Although I understand now, but phrasing it as a cookie cutter did not make sense to me initially.*

The key aspect of code that I got my intel from today was from this p5 sketch that [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-HGdc8L-7w) used in their video.

```
let bubble1;
let bubble2;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 400);
  bubble1 = new Bubble();
  bubble2 = new Bubble();
}

function draw() {
  background(0);
  bubble1.move();
  bubble1.show();
  bubble2.move();
  bubble2.show();
}

class Bubble {
  constructor(x, y, r) {
    this.x = 200;
    this.y = 150;
  }

  move() {
    this.x = this.x + random(-5, 5);
    this.y = this.y + random(-5, 5);
  }

  show() {
    stroke(255);
    strokeWeight(4);
    noFill();
    ellipse(this.x, this.y, 24, 24);
  }
}
```

From my understanding, this is how it can be broken down.

Every class needs a `constructor()` function, that is almost the same as the standard `setup()` function, however as it only applies to aspects within the class, variables can be assigned with the `this` attribute, which allows the variables to be local, instead of global. Also the `constructor()` is the place where you create any variables that your classes need, or will use.

From there, you can then create functions within the class to then be called back in the main section of the script. This allows you to easily recall longer functions multiple times to help reduce the length of the code. And if you know me, I'm all for saving time and tedious work.

One question that I have that I might experiment with however is that I wonder if classes can be used with just the constructor, and no other extra functions within it? I'll need to test this out later.
