### Well I should get started, shouldn't I...

Starting off is always the most daunting part of any task, so I might as well try and start somewhere.

Given my lack of knowledge in Javascript, to get started with this project, looking at other's works and taking inspiratation on them and how I can incoroporate them into my works is going to be one of the key factors into me creating the final design.

Today, I want to take a look at this sketch I found by [Chris Swift](https://editor.p5js.org/thisischrisswift/sketches).

The key aspect of this which I really like the look of is the fact that the circle follows where you mouse is when it is hovering on the campus.

This all comes from the following script;

```
function draw() {
  noFill();
  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 55, 55);
  stroke(50, 50);
  strokeWeight(.5);
}
```

It's really simple how it's working. Essinitally, all it's doing it create a circle (ellipse) and placing it on the location of the mouse's X and Y coordinates.

In a quick recreation using a basic text prompt, I tried to recreate something similar...

```
function draw() {
  background(220);
  text('DEMO', mouseX, mouseY)
}
```

There are two things I picked up with doing it in this manor.
1. It's easy to insert into any object, given it's just an X and Y value attribute.
2. I need to improve on figuring out how to do text.

In my exploration, I'll dive a bit more into how text works in Javascript, as that is something I need to know!

See you soon!
