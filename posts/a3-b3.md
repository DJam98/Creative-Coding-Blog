In this post, I want to look at ways to make my code usable for those without the knowledge of code, to easily download it and then use it and modify it for an intended purpose.

For this project, I'll just be breaking down the methods I tested for the [Player One project](https://github.com/DJam98/PlayerOneNowPlaying) I'm working on.

It needs a few things to make this type of code easily viewable and usable for anyone on the internet. 
Clear instructions on how to use
File and folder names to be easily and quickly understandable
Clear direction as to how it functions

### Clear Instructions
Thanks to GitHub, the first part is relatively easy to implement. GitHub allows for any file called `README.md` in the root folder to be displayed on the repositories landing page. So here is where we'll place all of the instructions on how to use the features of the software, including any prerequisites that are needed to have before launching the project, instructions on how to use it, controls, as well as some extra information if people wish to contribute to the project in the future as this is a public repository.


### File and Folder Naming

When creating projects for the public, you can't be assured that they'll read the instructions (even if it's called README), so I need to make sure files are named so that users can quickly understand what they need to do. 

The first part of this is clearly labelling what file needs to run for the project to work, which I did by calling it `RunMe.html`. This points to the user as to what file needs to be run. Then, the info file is where the user will put in all the information required for the project.

### Clear Direction
Within the `info.js` file, it's been labelled, even with the arrays, so that users know all the information, including what segment, song and artist number they're putting in. It has been arranged to make it as minimally overbearing as possible.

```
let song = [];
let artist = [];
let segment = [];

// 2023 | Season 2 | Week 4

// Segment Topics

segment [0] = "Starting Soon"
segment [1] = "Welcome"
segment [2] = "New and News"
segment [3] = "The Playlist"
segment [4] = "For The Glory"
segment [5] = "The Checkpoint"
segment [6] = "Your Way Or The Highway"
segment [7] = "What's Next"
segment [8] = "Better E3"
segment [9] = "The Quiz"
segment [10] = "Wrap Up"

// Songs and Artists

song [1] = "new heartbreak"
artist [1] = "sad alex"

song [2] = "nice to me"
artist [2] = "piri, Tommy Villiers"

song [3] = "All Of The Time"
artist [3] = "Jungle"

song [4] = "Torn"
artist [4] = "Jakka, Grace Menamie"

song [5] = "Get Down"
artist [5] = "FJØRA"

song [6] = "Romance + Rebellion"
artist [6] = "LÁLKA"

song [7] = "World of Colours"
artist [7] = "Hydelic"

song [8] = "Needles to Say"
artist [8] = "Fascinator"

song [9] = "#8 regret"
artist [9] = "Qumu"

song [10] = "Note to Self"
artist [10] = "Rahill"

song [11] = "Colgera Battle"
artist [11] = "Nintendo"

song [12] = "Through my Teeth"
artist [12] = "Ukiyo, Emila Ali"

song [13] = "Goodbye"
artist [13] = "Ramsey"

song [14] = "She's on Fire"
artist [14] = "Strange Ranger"

song [15] = "Snake Eater"
artist [15] = "Cythia Harrell"

song [16] = "Just Cool"
artist [16] = "Obongjayar"

song [17] = "Champions"
artist [17] = "The Tech Thieves"

song [18] = "Hello Goodbye"
artist [18] = "Stevan"

song [19] = "Summer Healing"
artist [19] = "STVN, Palm City"

// End of Show

song [20] = "See Us Again Next Week"
artist [20] = "Mondays 8pm AEST"
```

And that's that! Hopefully, this gives an insight into my thought process regarding this task and why having this project created for a public-facing perspective was engaging for me.
