Now while I may have looked at things like classes, interaction, and conditionals, I've kinda dived into the deep end to understand these ideas, without having a proper look at some of the basic versions of iteration. So today, I really want to have a look at how `for` works. Today, I'll be using [Thomas Capogrepo's](http://thomas.capogre.co/rmit/ccs/2022/08/21/iteration.html) blog post as a base for my investigations and the following piece of code.

<iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/capogreco/full/nrXXEXOBN" width="400" height="200"></iframe>

```
function setup () {
  createCanvas (400, 200)
  fill ('hotpink')
  noStroke ()
  noLoop () // do not loop draw 
}

function draw () {
  background ('turquoise')
  
  for (let x = 5; x < width; x += 20) {
    square (x, 95, 10)
  }  
}
```

From what I'm understanding, it seems quite similar to an `if` statement, however it allows for a iteration to occur more easily, as it's all defined within the paramaters of the `for` loop.

Given the basics of this, I'll proabbly find a way to incorporate this, as it is absolutly a lot more simple than what I've done on just relying on `if` statements.
