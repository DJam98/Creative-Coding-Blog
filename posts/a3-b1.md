We're in it now, the final stretch! Going into this assignment, I have two communities of practice that I want to engage with. The first is the radio show I run (Player One on Syn), and the second is I run for the online community, an online tournament organisation - Off the Dial.

In this blog post, I want to look into something that would be nice to ingrate with Off the Dial: migrating our stream overlay package to a WebSocket system. While the system we have currently does function, the main disadvantage is that it can only run locally and on Windows, which not only reduces the number of people who can assist with live streaming our tournaments, but also it puts more stress on the broadcaster as they have to manage this overlays system, as well as the broadcast software (OBS) and the spectator camera work in the game (Splatoon 3).

By migrating to a WebSocket system, we could remove both constraints as it would be hosted online (allowing any operating system to use the system). This would also allow us to assign someone else to manage the overlay system, reducing the stress on the broadcaster.

For my investigation here, I'll look into Thomas Capogreco's [ds template](https://github.com/capogreco/ds_ctrl_template).

The key aspect of this system is that there are two points of contact: the client and the controller. Additionally, there is a 'server' to communicate between the client and the controller. The entire system is built so that the server file transfers the information between the client and controller.

This works similarly to what we already have. Only our version is currently hosted locally. There is a controller panel (see below)...

... and a client screen.

But before going into this project too far, I'll need to take a look and discussion with the person who made our overlays initially to see if our systems are even compatible.
