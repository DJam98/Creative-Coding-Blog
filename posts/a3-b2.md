Now that covid is *mostly* dealt with, I can finally get back on track with this! Now, a major aspect that I need to incorporate into this project is that it needs to have **interaction**. And the way I think I want to do this is by incorporating the mouse click to trigger an event within my script.

Today, we'll be looking at a bit more of a simplier example, as this is just taken from the [p5 Reference Docs](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/mouseClicked)

<iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/DJam98/full/cJRm7o4ziw" width="400" height="400"></iframe>

```
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

let value = 0;
function draw() {
  fill(value);
  rect(25, 25, 50, 50);
}

function mouseClicked() {
  if (value === 0) {
    value = 255;
  } else {
    value = 0;
  }
}
```

Now, what I like about this version of interaction compared to other types of interaction, is that it's a whole function were it does repeatedly occur, unlike mouse tracking. Essintially, it'll start a function whenever the mouse is clicked.

One downside about this though is that within the limits of p5, I can't draw within this function, I only seem to be able to change variables, so I'll need to workout ways that allows me to create objects when a mouse is clicked, if this is something I wish to pursue. Or I can just change values and call it a day. We'll see where this project takes us.
